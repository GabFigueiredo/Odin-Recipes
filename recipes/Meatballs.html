<p>Make this a true dump dinner by opting for pre-made meatballs from your butcher or local grocery store. They're tossed with a blend of crushed tomatoes, spaghetti sauce, and tomato pur√©e to create a delightful Italian-inspired dish. Tuck into a bun for meatball subs, or serve over pasta with Parmesan.</p>
